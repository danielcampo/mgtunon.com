		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Change. What a curious thing. At times we embrace it for the promise it holds of a better tomorrow. At times we resist it for fear of being forced out of our comfort zone, left to stand on the threshold of the unknown. Regardless of where we fall on the change-aptitude scale, change is inevitable. As a business owner, entrepreneur or manager, your ability to deal with change will greatly influence your ability to effectively lead your organization. You can be reactionary, or you can be revolutionary. You pick.</p>

		<title>Despite Improving Economy, Small Business Owners Still Looking For Recovery</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Interesting research by the Discover Small Business Watch Index tracking March Confidence Indicators.  <a href="http://www.discovercard.com/business/watch/">http://www.discovercard.com/business/watch/</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here's the bottom line folks, we're still in the trenches.  It's tiring, I know.  We've been at it a long time, but most of us in the small business world have to continue to fight to get out of the hole.  That means that everyone in the organization is responsible for increasing revenue (read: sales), and lowering costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">No matter what you do, there's probably a way to do it better and more efficiently.  Find it and implement it.  Quantify the cost savings.  Track your progress.  Share what you've learned with others.  Efficiency can be contagious - and your responsible for spreading it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As for increasing revenue, know this: We're all in sales.  Period.  Whether you're the receptionist or the CEO, you can have a direct impact on sales.  Every point of contact, every opportunity to connect, is a potential sale or referral.  Do not misunderstand me - there's a right way and there's a wrong way to go about this.  I'm certainly not suggesting you turn in to that obnoxious salesperson you try to avoid at every party and weekend social function.  I'm talking about building relationships.  Understanding possible connections between the people you come across and your business - the products or services your company offers.  Our Director of Marketing and Communications identified a potential client while having a cigar on a Friday night with friends.  Nothing pushy or inappropriate - just a connection.  It's a beautiful thing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Never Stop Growing...</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This probably isn’t what you want to hear right now – not in the midst of this global recession, when just hanging on is hard enough to do – but despite the difficulties, when it comes
to business, if you’re not growing, you're dying.  This may seem like a difficult message to hear, but bear with me because there’s more to that statement than the obvious.

In business, when we speak of growth, we typically think in terms of quantifiable increases in sales and revenue, market share and stock prices – and we are certainly right to do so.  We all want to hit the mark when it comes to our numbers.  After all, that’s the bottom line we’re talking about, and there are few things more critical in business than growing the numbers.  But what do you do when the numbers just aren’t there?  What happens when your ability to externally grow your business is severely compromised by crippling market conditions?  Many companies rightfully go into survival mode.  They drastically cut costs and look for immediate work to, at best, maintain the status quo or, at least, stop the bleeding.   But does operating your business in survival mode while navigating the worst global recession since the 1930s necessarily mean no growth?  Of course not.  At the moment you may not be able to grow your business, but you can certainly grow your organization – and that can be just as important.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to grow your organization even when you can't grow your business:</span></strong>

<strong>The Mission Statement: </strong>

If you don’t already have a mission statement, create one.  It doesn’t have to be long or elaborate, it just has to be sincere and real.  If one already exists, take the time to evaluate it.  Improve it if you have to, and remove any part of it that you realize may be irrelevant to what your organization is actually all about.  Successfully growing your business means staying true to who you are as an organization.  The mission statement will not only help you define that, but it will help you communicate it internally and externally.

<strong>Define Your Organizational Values and State Your Purpose:</strong>

Research shows that organizations with clearly defined core values, and a definite purpose outperform comparable companies in their markets by substantial margins.  No organization should have more than four or five core values because maintaining them is not an easy task.  As Collins and Porras explain in their book, Built To Last, there’s a difference between a core value and a current strategy.  If a value can last a lifetime, then it’s core, otherwise it’s a current strategy.  Likewise, the purpose must define why the organization exists beyond profit.  This may sound basic, but it’s critical to growing the organization, and there’s no better time than the present to do it.

<strong>Prepare Your Strategic Five Year Plan:</strong>

While looking for immediate work is obviously your number one priority, begin strategizing your business growth over the next five years by analyzing potential growth markets and the resources you’ll need to penetrate those markets.  The planning process is critical to growing the organization because it maps out the course for future growth and helps you prepare internally for that growth.

<strong>The Organizational Chart:</strong>

If you're like most business owners, you’ve probably been forced to downsize your organization.  This is the perfect time to create a new and improved organizational chart and begin your “topgrading” plan.  That way, when you're ready to start hiring again, you’ll bring in only the best people for the job.

<strong>Evaluate Standard Operating Procedures:</strong>

Sometimes the nicest thing I can say about “procedures” is that they are a necessary evil.  We obviously cannot function without them, but every once in a while it’s important to revisit our standard operating procedures and make the necessary improvements, lest we become slaves to them.  The last thing you want to hear from  your team is, “That’s how we’ve
always done it.”    Often times, slight procedural changes can result in monumental organizational growth because we effectively move the entire organization out of its comfort zone and into a mindset that allows it to start growing again.

Here’s a final thought on organizational growth.  Though our bodies stop growing when we’re in our late teens and early twenties, our mind, our personality, and our consciousness continue to grow and develop.  The same is true of our organizations – no matter how bad the economy might be.  Never stop growing one way or another, my friends, because if you're not growing…  You know.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New Twist To Hispanic Demographic Growth</title>
		<link>http://www.mgtunon.com/blog/entries/new-twist-to-hispanic-demographic-growth</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The cover story in the May issue of Hispanic Business Magazine, Growing Hispanic Presence, provides an excellent summary of the 2010 census while tracking demographic trends.  From population growth in the unlikeliest of places to the one trillion dollars in purchasing power the numbers are staggering.  But perhaps the most impressive tidbit can be summed up in the article's subtitle: "More youthful population poised to have greater influence in all segments of American society."  And according to Mark Hugo Lopez of the Pew Hispanic Center, in the last decade, "more population growth among Hispanics came from native-born births as opposed to new immigration."

Now they're talking about me and my generation.  First generation born in the US.  Completely bi-cultural and bilingual, yet with English as our first language.  What a powerful demographic sector!  It's impossible for me to list all the ways this generation of mine will influence American society - you have to simply spend some time contemplating it yourself - but you can imagine how the doors to furthering market reach, exponentially, can be kicked wide open.  As Corporate America continues its attempt to reach the growing Hispanic demographic, who better to represent than this new generation?  As the growing Hispanic demographic strives to assimilate in the US, who better to lead the way than this new generation.  Regardless of the industry you're in, this information can have a positive affect on your business.  The opportunities for creating value are endless.  Think about it...  Before you do, though, I recommend you read the article.  <a href="http://hispanicbusinessdigital.epubxpress.com/">http://hispanicbusinessdigital.epubxpress.com/</a>

More to come...]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Marketing to Hispanics Evolving... Finally</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As expected, the 2010 Cenus is revealing some impressive facts ref Hispanic demographics - which leads to some unexpected conclusions about Hispanic trends...  This article on Marketing to Hispanics shows just how quickly major corporations are reacting to these trends.  Of particular interest to me is the departure (finally) from anything having to do with Hispanics being Spanish-only.  Dont get me wrong, I'm proficiently bilingual and bicultural, and I deal in Spanish-only situations constantemente (constantly...), but like millions of young, professional, US-born Hispanic Americans, English is my first language.  It's about time we see mainstream marketing targeting Hispanics without leaving the mainstream.

I recommend this article from my colleague, Alejandra Labanca, at the Miami Herald.  Interesting story...  <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/06/05/2251284/marketing-to-hispanics-takes-center.html">http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/06/05/2251284/marketing-to-hispanics-takes-center.html</a>

		<title>Two Things: Spoelstra and Small Businesses</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[First, Spoelstra:  He has a lot to learn from Riley about how a coach is supposed to bring out the best from his players.  Much like business owners and managers... IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT EXECUTION!  If it were only about that, the Heat would have won handedly.  No, beyond execution there must be inspiration.  Meaning.  Purpose.  The Mavs weren't necessarily better than the Heat, they were better at gelling as a team.  They were better at rallying all of their combined resources into the communal pot.  In the process they were professional and highly effective while Wade and James fained a sickness to mock Nowitzki.  Stupid.  The Heat were outplayed, out-coached, out-everything.  Congratulations, Mavs.  You earned it.

Now to business:  We must focus on small businesses if we are to truly experience a recovery.  Otherwise the forecasts are... not so good. <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/smallbusiness/2011-06-13-small-business-start-ups-fewer_n.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/money/smallbusiness/2011-06-13-small-business-start-ups-fewer_n.htm</a>

		<title>Three Business Cards</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had lunch this week of a friend of mine who works for the largest bank in Europe – larger than BBA and Santander combined with over 100,000 employees…  Anyway, he has three business cards: one for Florida, one for Central America, and one for the Caribbean.

<em>What a waste of paper</em>, I thought to myself, so I asked him, “Why don’t you just consolidate and list your three regions onto one card?”  His response blew me away, “Because we want each person in their respective region to know that we are focused on <em>them</em>.  Each region, and each person, gets my undivided attention – not my attention divided by three – so company policy dictates that I need to have three business cards.”

Isn’t it interesting how such a large, global institution would place so much emphasis on the personal attention to detail that it would go out of its way to print three business cards?
Clearly the challenge lies in actually delivering that personalized service at such a micro level lest they risk falling into that boiling caldron of falsehoods and nifty slogans which no longer fly in this cynical post Great Recession era.  But by all accounts, my understanding is that this behemoth backs it up.  I’ve only heard good things – and from different sources.

I don’t need to name names – you can figure out who’s who…  Just consider that if one of the big jungs finds it important enough to focus so intently on their relationship with each individual client, then so should you.  But remember, this organizational value, this level of commitment to the customer, is subject to gravity: it absolutely must trickle down from the top.  You can have an immediate impact on your customers and on your bottom line if you focus on, and guide your organization toward, such personalized service.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Juan Tamayo’s excellent article in today’s El Nuevo Herald reminds us all of how oppressive a government can be toward its people.

It’s been happening for more than 50 years in Cuba, and it continues to this very day – make no mistake about it.  Maybe that’s why we've become somewhat anesthetized to the topic of Cuba’s human rights violations; we’ve been hearing about it for so long that it’s faded into the background of our emotional perception like a sort of white noise we come to accept.  I
also understand that, at times, we take the issue for granted because we live in the greatest nation on earth, and regardless of how we might feel about our government at any given point in time, we are still truly free.  But the Cuban people are simply not free.

I also understand that, unless we have personally lived through it, as my parents and grandparents have (I have not… thankfully), we will never truly understand.  But we can appreciate.  That’s what Bono and U2 reminded us during their (kick ass) concert at Sun Life Stadium in Miami last week.  As reported by Juan Tamayo in the attached article, “one week after rock icon Bono honored him during a U2 concert in Miami, Cuban dissident Oscar Elias Biscet has been ordered by police to check in once a month.”  Bono praised the 49 year old doctor during the concert with a request to the 73,000 in attendance:  <em>“We’d like to do something we've never done before,” Bono declared as he urged the audience to hold up their hands. “A beautiful man, a doctor who spent time in the prisons of Cuba. He was released. His name is Doctor Biscet.  I want you to hold him up and let everyone in Cuba know he is special to us and we are watching, we are watching,” he added.  “Hold him in your thoughts. Hold him in your prayers.”</em> Tamayo’s excellent reporting, and this subsequent article, tells the rest of the story.

As you read the article, I ask you to join me in thanking Bono and U2 for bringing this issue of Cuba’s blatant human rights violations to international prominence – and for doing it so beautifully.  Join me in congratulating Tamayo for his excellent work.  Join me in a commitment to appreciate what’s going on, and to never forget.
